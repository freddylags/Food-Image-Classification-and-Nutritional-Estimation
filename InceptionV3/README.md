# AI System - Food Image Classification for Nutritional Estimation

### InceptionV3 Versions
| Version | Description |
|---------|------------|
| **Version 1** | Implemented and tested on Jupyter Notebook with **1, 5, 10, and all** classes. |
| **Version 2** | Implemented and run on **Google Colab** with **10 and all** classes for **20 epochs**. |
| **Version 3 (Best)** | Implemented and run on **Google Colab** with **all classes for 100 epochs**, using **additional data augmentation**. |
| **Version 4** | Implemented and run on **Google Colab** with **10 and all** classes for **20 epochs**, using **EfficientNet-inspired preprocessing and layer implementation**. |
| **Version 5** | Implemented and run on **Google Colab** with **all** classes for **100 epochs**, following a similar approach to **Version 2**. |

## Model Training
- Uses **InceptionV3** as a base model.
- Fine-tuning applied in later stages.
- Augmented data for better generalization.
- Evaluation on validation/test splits.
